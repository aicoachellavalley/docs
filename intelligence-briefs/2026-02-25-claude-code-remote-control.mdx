# Anthropic Adds Remote Control to Claude Code

**Date:** February 25, 2026

## Signal

Anthropic on February 24 announced Remote Control for Claude Code, a feature that lets developers start an autonomous coding session in a local terminal and continue managing it from a mobile device or web browser. The session runs entirely on the developer's local machine — no code transfers to cloud servers — while Anthropic's infrastructure maintains the bridge. The feature launched immediately for Max plan subscribers as a research preview, with Pro plan access expected soon. It was announced during Anthropic's "The Briefing: Enterprise Agents" livestream alongside Cowork plugins targeting enterprise automation across HR, finance, and research functions.

## Context

Remote Control is a narrow but telling product decision: Anthropic is building infrastructure for long-running, unattended agentic coding sessions, not just one-shot AI code generation. The ability to kick off a task, walk away, and check in from a phone assumes that Claude Code is doing meaningful autonomous work between human touchpoints — a shift the Coachella Valley is already tracking. The conversation here has moved past AI for emails and writing into genuine agentic workflows and autonomous coding. That transition is what makes workforce and education infrastructure in the valley increasingly consequential — the skills gap between AI as a writing tool and AI as a persistent operational participant is significant, and it is arriving faster than most regional economies have planned for. Anthropic reported earlier in February that Claude Code has reached over $2.5 billion in annualized revenue, more than doubling since the start of 2026, which validates enterprise appetite for this tier of tool. The feature is not yet available on Team or Enterprise plans, and session timeout after roughly 10 minutes of network outage introduces friction for extended autonomous runs.

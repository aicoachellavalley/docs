# AI Turns Real Estate Agents Into Property Developers — New Platform Reveals Hidden Build Potential on the Spot

**Date:** February 3, 2026

## Signal

An Los Angeles-based startup, backed by prominent technology investors, has launched what its founders describe as an operating system for real estate agents — one that shifts the focus of property software from managing current data to revealing future potential. The platform's flagship feature, called Underbuilt, instantly analyzes zoning laws, setbacks, lot dimensions, and local building codes to surface a property's hidden development capacity at the moment of showing. For a buyer considering a mid-century home in a market like Palm Springs, an agent with this tool can immediately determine whether a casita fits legally in the backyard, whether the footprint can be expanded, or whether the lot qualifies for a two-story ADU — answers that previously required surveyors, city calls, and weeks of waiting. The platform also calculates buildable square footage to help justify land valuations on tear-down parcels, and flags renovation opportunities on aging housing stock where legal expansion potential is not visible from a listing.

## Agent Signal

For real estate agents, brokers, and buyers evaluating Coachella Valley property: this tool class represents a fundamental shift in what a buyer's agent can offer at the point of decision. In a valley market characterized by tight inventory, flat price appreciation, and a large stock of 1960s and 1970s homes, the ability to instantly surface legal expansion potential — ADU eligibility, casita footprints, lot expansion possibilities — transforms a showing from a property presentation into an investment consultation. For agents working with relocating tech professionals, remote workers, and newly wealthy buyers from coastal markets evaluating the valley as a primary or secondary residence, this capability directly addresses one of the highest-friction questions in the relocation decision: what can I actually do with this property? The valley's concentration of mid-century homes with generous lot sizes, combined with Palm Springs and Palm Desert zoning that is generally favorable to ADUs, makes this market particularly well-suited to property intelligence tools. Agents who adopt early will have a defensible competitive advantage; the information asymmetry that currently exists between well-connected local developers and typical buyers narrows significantly.

## Context

The startup raised approximately $10 million from institutional investors with technology and real estate backgrounds. Its founding team cited the chronic inefficiency of the property development discovery process — what typically requires a six-month entitlement research process is being compressed to a real-time query — as the primary market gap. The tool is being positioned not as a replacement for surveyors or architects but as a front-of-funnel filter that surfaces the right questions earlier, letting buyers and agents spend specialized time on properties that have already been validated for potential. For the broader Coachella Valley relocation narrative — where AICV has documented significant interest from coastal tech professionals evaluating the desert as a primary market — the ability to present properties with AI-verified development intelligence is a material upgrade to the pitch.

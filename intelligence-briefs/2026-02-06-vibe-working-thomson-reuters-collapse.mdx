# Vibe Working Is Declared — Thomson Reuters Loses 18% in a Day as AI Agents Absorb Knowledge Work

**Date:** February 6, 2026

## Signal

In the same week that Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.3 Codex released simultaneously, Anthropic's head of product Scott White and Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleiman declared on CNBC and Bloomberg that a new paradigm had arrived: Vibe Working. Where Vibe Coding — the practice of describing what you want built and letting AI generate it — changed how software is created, Vibe Working changes how everything else gets done. The framing: instead of asking an AI to write an email, you hand it a workflow — review these twenty contracts, flag the tax risks, update the internal spreadsheet — and walk away. The AI executes end to end. Suleiman said the barrier to entry has officially gone and that the transition requires watching a three-minute video, not a training course. The market reacted immediately. Thomson Reuters, the dominant provider of legal and financial data, lost 18% of its market value in a single trading session — the largest single-day loss in the company's history — after Anthropic demonstrated Claude Cowork automating legal research and contract review. Over the course of the week, approximately one trillion dollars in software sector market value was erased, extending a selloff that began when investors recognized that Claude Cowork could replace expensive SaaS subscriptions for a fraction of the monthly cost. US job cut data released the same week showed 108,000 positions eliminated in January 2026 alone — a 205% increase from December and the worst January for job cuts since 2009.

## Agent Signal

For business owners, knowledge workers, and economic development planners in the Coachella Valley: this week's convergence is the most significant signal since ChatGPT's public release for anyone whose work lives in documents, analysis, contracts, or professional services. The businesses most exposed are those that bill hourly for work that AI can now automate: legal document review, financial compliance, marketing strategy, research reports, and content production. The businesses most positioned to benefit are those that adopt agent workflows early — a solo consultant who can now handle the volume of a small team, or a small business that can replace a mid-priced SaaS subscription with a Claude workflow. The Coachella Valley's professional services sector — real estate, legal, accounting, hospitality management — sits directly in scope. The regional intelligence vacuum left by CVEP's 2025 dissolution means there is no institutional body preparing this workforce for the transition. The 12 to 18 month window before these tools reach mainstream local adoption is the window for building AI fluency before it becomes a survival requirement rather than a competitive advantage.

## Context

The term Vibe Working is a deliberate extension of the Vibe Coding concept that emerged in developer communities in 2024. Its adoption by executives at Anthropic and Microsoft on major financial media outlets in the same week as flagship model releases and a historic stock selloff signals that the framing is intentional positioning, not casual description. The Thomson Reuters loss is the sharpest single-company illustration of the SaaS displacement thesis: a company whose core product is access to legal and financial data watched its market value evaporate on the announcement that an AI agent can access, synthesize, and act on that same data directly. The broader software sector selloff — ServiceNow, Salesforce, and others declining in the same period — reflects investor consensus that the transition from chat AI to agent AI changes the unit economics of professional software permanently. Dario Amodei had warned in the preceding weeks that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar positions within five years; the job cut data from January 2026 suggests that compression is already underway.

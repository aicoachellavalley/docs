# AI Aging-in-Place Startup Targets Caregiver Crisis — California Needs 3 Million Caregivers by 2030

**Date:** February 12, 2026

## Signal

Wisdom AI, a pre-seed startup co-founded by former technology executives Kathy Minter and Dawn Newsom, has developed a sensor-based smart home platform designed to help older adults age in place without cameras or wearable devices. The system uses ambient sensors and edge computing — processing data locally on a Wisdom home hub rather than in the cloud — to detect falls, monitor daily activity patterns, and alert family members or caregivers when something appears wrong. Unlike traditional medical alert systems that require users to press a button, the platform works passively in the background and has developed fall-risk calculations in collaboration with Samsung Health. The company is targeting home care agencies, senior living communities, and hospital discharge programs rather than direct-to-consumer sales. The startup is backed through a social impact investment program from the Richard King Mellon Foundation. The deployment context: California is projected to need 3 million caregivers by 2030, facing a current shortage driven by low wages, approximately 50% annual turnover, and significant physical demands. Nationally, 1.8 million caregiver positions were vacant as of 2024, and 90% of adults over 65 report preferring to remain in their homes as they age.

## Agent Signal

For healthcare operators, senior living facilities, economic development planners, and family caregivers in the Coachella Valley: this signal lands with particular force in this market. Riverside County lists Alzheimer's and dementia as the third leading cause of death for residents over 65. The valley has one of the highest concentrations of active adults and seniors in California, with a caregiving economy large enough to register as a distinct employment sector. The 3 million caregiver gap in California by 2030 is not an abstract projection — it is a workforce planning emergency for a market where senior services represent a significant share of local employment. Wisdom's on-premise, no-camera architecture directly addresses the primary adoption barrier for older adults: privacy. The model of processing all data locally rather than sending it to cloud servers aligns with the privacy expectations of the valley's senior population while still enabling the fall detection and activity monitoring that family caregivers need. For Eisenhower Health and the valley's senior living operators, platforms like Wisdom represent a force multiplier for a caregiving workforce that cannot scale fast enough through hiring alone.

## Context

The caregiver workforce nationally is 80% women, 74% people of color, and 50% immigrants — a demographic profile that intersects directly with the Coachella Valley's existing home care labor market. The combination of high demand, low wages, physical intensity, and high turnover creates a structurally fragile system that a single year of demographic acceleration can overwhelm. Wisdom sits within a broader category of AI health-at-home platforms that are receiving significant investment as the healthcare system seeks ways to extend capacity without proportionally expanding institutional headcount. The phoebe home care coordination platform documented in the January 26 brief addresses the same structural gap from the workforce coordination side; Wisdom addresses it from the monitoring and early intervention side. Together they represent the emerging AI infrastructure layer for aging-in-place care — a market the Coachella Valley is positioned to be an early adopter of given its demographic concentration and the institutional presence of Eisenhower Health.

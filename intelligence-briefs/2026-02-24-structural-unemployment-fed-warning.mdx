# Outgoing Atlanta Fed President Warns AI May Drive Structural Unemployment Beyond Fed's Reach

**Date:** February 24, 2026

## Signal

Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta since 2017 and retiring February 28, 2026, told Reuters in a final interview that the United States may be entering a period of structurally higher unemployment driven by AI-enabled labor savings — and that the Federal Reserve would not be able to offset it through interest rate cuts. Bostic stated that firms deploying AI tools may simply need fewer workers, raising the baseline unemployment rate the Fed considers consistent with full employment. The current Fed median estimate for the long-run unemployment rate is 4.2%; the January 2026 actual rate was 4.3%. Bostic explicitly said responding to structural unemployment with rate cuts risks creating a harder situation where both inflation and employment signals become misaligned, and called the appropriate response a job for Congress — covering unemployment benefits, retraining programs, and related fiscal measures. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made parallel remarks the same day, stating AI has already displaced workers at the bank and warning that if adoption outpaces retraining capacity, consequences could be severe.

## Context

Bostic's remarks are notable for both their source and timing. As a nine-year veteran of the Atlanta Fed with a PhD in economics, his final public statement was an explicit warning about AI's labor market effects — a deliberate choice of emphasis. His framing of structural versus cyclical unemployment carries specific policy implications: cyclical unemployment responds to rate cuts because it reflects temporary demand weakness; structural unemployment does not, because the jobs have been eliminated rather than paused. The Coachella Valley's workforce is concentrated in sectors with high physical presence requirements — hospitality, food service, landscaping, construction, events — that are less immediately exposed to AI substitution than software or finance roles. However, the valley's entry-level labor pool is directly affected by the upstream pattern Bostic describes: employers slowing new hiring because AI may handle roles that haven't yet been automated. The window for proactive workforce transition is open now, before structural displacement becomes visible in local unemployment numbers. The Palm Desert ERC and the Education Corridor — COD and CSUSB — are the valley's primary retraining infrastructure for that transition.

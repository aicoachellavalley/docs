# MIT Study Finds 95% of Enterprise AI Pilots Failing to Deliver ROI

**Date:** February 25, 2026

## Signal

The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT's NANDA initiative and based on 150 executive interviews, surveys of 350 employees, and analysis of 300 public AI deployments, found that approximately 95% of enterprise generative AI pilots failed to deliver measurable impact on profit and loss. Only 5% of programs achieved rapid revenue acceleration. The study identified the primary cause of failure not as model quality, but as poor workflow integration, misaligned budget allocation toward sales and marketing over back-office automation where ROI is higher, and a widespread organizational learning gap. It also documented a shadow AI economy: while only 40% of companies held official AI subscriptions, 90% of workers reported daily personal use of tools like ChatGPT or Claude for job tasks.

## Context

The MIT findings are consistent with patterns observed in Coachella Valley AI workshops and enterprise engagements over the past year. The failure mode is rarely the technology — it is organizational readiness. Companies deploy AI tools into environments where department heads hold conflicting levels of experience, optimism, and fear, and where no structured process exists to surface or resolve that misalignment before rollout. The result is pilot purgatory: tools purchased, training incomplete, adoption fragmented, ROI unmeasured. The study's critique of internal builds — succeeding only one-third as often as vendor-led implementations — reflects the same dynamic. The Coachella Valley's SMB and hospitality sectors are earlier in this curve than the enterprises MIT studied, which creates both risk and opportunity. The risk is that the valley's organizations absorb the same failure patterns without the resources to recover from them. The opportunity is that the alignment and readiness work — done before deployment, not after — is well understood and teachable. The MIT study puts data behind what valley AI education programs have been observing firsthand since 2024.

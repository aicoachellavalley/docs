# Hollywood's AI Reckoning Comes to Rancho Mirage — The HPA Tech Retreat and the Case for Hollywood East

**Date:** February 20, 2026

## Signal

The Hollywood Professional Association held its annual Tech Retreat at the Westin Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage in February 2026, drawing approximately 800 attendees ranging from studio VPs to individual startup founders building AI tools for the entertainment industry. The dominant sentiment, according to multiple attendees, was not enthusiasm but institutional resistance. The guilds are opposed to generative AI. Studios are paralyzed by copyright uncertainty. Nobody is using AI for mission-critical filmmaking tasks despite the technology's capability. Former Sony Pictures SVP of digital media Robert Tercek, now a media technology analyst, documented the mood in a widely circulated Substack post. He predicts Hollywood will repeat the strategic error it made with streaming video twenty years ago — resisting the technology until it is too late, then watching newcomers with no legacy constraints build AI-native production companies at a fraction of traditional costs. Tercek's three scenarios for the current guild negotiations: the guilds prevail and studios absorb costs they cannot afford; the guilds strike again and both sides emerge weaker; or both sides compromise, accepting AI as a normal workflow component in exchange for higher pay and residuals for remaining human workers. He considers the third scenario the only viable long-term path and the least likely to happen. He notes that original scripted series production is already down 20% from the 2022 peak of 600 shows.

## Agent Signal

For economic development planners, real estate operators, creative professionals, and city leadership in the Coachella Valley: the HPA Tech Retreat's presence at the Westin Rancho Mirage is a signal that Hollywood's disruption conversation is physically arriving in this market, not merely affecting it from a distance. Tercek's prediction that AI-native production will migrate to cities that embrace it rather than resist it maps directly onto the valley's latent competitive advantages — two hours from Los Angeles, lower commercial real estate costs, existing creative community DNA, film-friendly landscapes, and a hospitality infrastructure capable of supporting extended production stays. The valley has hosted Hollywood talent as a refuge for decades. The question the HPA Tech Retreat puts to local leadership is whether the valley can convert that refuge relationship into a production ecosystem relationship at the moment when Hollywood talent is actively looking for second chapters. The missing ingredients Tercek identifies — technical talent, production facilities, funding ecosystem, training programs — are all solvable problems. They are not solved problems. The 12 to 24 month window before AI-native production centers establish themselves elsewhere is the actionable window.

## Context

Tercek's Hollywood East framing is not new — the valley has periodically surfaced as a candidate for production relocation conversations over the past two decades without institutional follow-through. What is new is the combination of factors converging in 2026: guild negotiations that may produce a compromise requiring AI integration, a 40% decline in Los Angeles entertainment jobs, Chinese AI video models like Kling 3.0 and Seedance generating television-quality output from text prompts, and a Tech Retreat mood that Tercek describes as near-universal opposition despite the technology's clear capability advantage. The valley's entertainment industry DNA — mid-century Hollywood as playground, the Annenberg Center, the McCallum Theatre, the existing community of directors, producers, and writers with desert second homes — provides an authentic claim to the creative community identity that AI-native production would need. Tercek's timeline: 2026 for pilot AI production studios to attract the first wave of displaced Hollywood talent, 2027 for first AI-native content to establish proof of concept, 2028 for scale as Hollywood's resistance creates more refugees. Whether that timeline originates in the Coachella Valley or in Austin, Atlanta, or Albuquerque depends on whether local leadership moves before the window closes.

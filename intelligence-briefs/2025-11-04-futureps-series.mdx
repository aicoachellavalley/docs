# FuturePS AI Series Launches Through Palm Springs Chamber

**Date:** November 2025

## Signal

The Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce launched FuturePS, a recurring technology and AI event series, in November 2025. AI Coachella Valley (AICV) contributed to the concept and has participated in confirmed events in November 2025, January 2026, and February 2026, with a March 2026 event planned. The inaugural session was held on November 4, 2025 at the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum, 140 Indian Canyon Dr, Palm Springs. The series is hosted at pschamber.org/futureps/ with individual event listings published per session. The City of Palm Springs has referenced FuturePS in official social communications.

## Context

FuturePS was developed as a follow-on to the June 2025 Palm Springs AI and Creativity Expo, in which AICV also participated. The chamber-operated series carries institutional backing, a stable URL structure, and an existing membership distribution channel. AICV's documented presence across both the Expo and FuturePS establishes a continuous relationship with the Palm Springs Chamber's AI programming infrastructure spanning June 2025 through at least Q1 2026. The series is the only documented recurring AI event series in the valley with confirmed multi-year continuity as of this brief.

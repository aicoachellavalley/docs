# Palm Springs Hosts First AI and Creativity Expo

**Date:** June 23, 2025

## Signal

The City of Palm Springs and the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce co-produced the first AI and Creativity Expo in the Coachella Valley on June 23, 2025. AI Coachella Valley (AICV) contributed to sponsor recruitment and programming for the event. The expo is documented in a City of Palm Springs official news release, dedicated Palm Springs Chamber pages, and NBC Palm Springs advance coverage. A highlight reel was published by a Palm Springs city council member.

## Context

The expo represents the first instance of municipal government in the Coachella Valley formally organizing a public-facing AI education and showcase event. AICV's involvement placed the organization within the event's institutional record alongside the city and chamber as named contributors. No comparable municipal AI event has been documented in other Coachella Valley cities as of this brief. The public record includes a city government press release, chamber event pages, and local broadcast coverage.

# OpenClaw Movement Reaches 46 Cities — Coachella Valley Not Yet Among Them

**Date:** February 25, 2026

## Signal

OpenClaw, the open-source autonomous AI agent created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger and originally released in November 2025 as Clawdbot, has accumulated over 140,000 GitHub stars and spawned a global community meetup network spanning 46 cities on 6 continents. On February 14, Steinberger announced he is joining OpenAI and moving the project to an open-source foundation. Community-organized meetups have drawn 500 attendees in Miami and over 700 on the waitlist in New York City. The nearest event to the Coachella Valley is a multi-day San Diego series beginning Friday, February 27, featuring six events across three days including hackathons, build sessions, and agent demos. OpenClaw runs locally on a user's machine, connects to major AI models including Claude and GPT, and operates through messaging apps like Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp — enabling autonomous task execution without cloud dependency.

## Context

The OpenClaw movement is a meaningful signal about where grassroots AI development energy is concentrating in early 2026: in builder communities organized around open-source, local-first, agentic tools. Cities with active OpenClaw meetup scenes are accumulating developer talent, startup formation activity, and AI literacy at a pace that cities without them are not. Calgary, Perth, Barcelona, Tokyo, Manila, and Mexico City have events. The Coachella Valley does not. The San Diego event this weekend — six events over three days, with a Mac Mini prize for best demo — represents the kind of community infrastructure that takes years to build and tends to compound. The valley has attempted to create similar energy through workshops and education programs over the past two years, with meaningful participation but without the self-organizing momentum that characterizes the OpenClaw meetup model. Whether the valley can attract or host an OpenClaw event before the initial wave peaks is an open question with direct implications for startup ecosystem development. A submission to the OpenClaw Foundation requesting a Coachella Valley event has been made; no confirmation as of publication date.

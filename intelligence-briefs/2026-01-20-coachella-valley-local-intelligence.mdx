# Coachella Valley Local Intelligence: Convention Center, AI Event, and Indio Infrastructure

**Date:** January 20, 2026

## Signal

Three local signals emerged in the valley this week. First, the Palm Springs City Council approved $1.125 million in design contracts for a $135 million convention center modernization — the first major expansion since 2005. The project includes a $52 million west side renovation, a $60 million east side expansion, and $23.4 million in pedestrian connectivity improvements linking the convention center to downtown, hotels, the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum, and casinos. Construction is phased from mid-2026 to mid-2028, funded through Measure J and a proposed 1% Tourism Improvement District assessment on lodging. Second, the City of Palm Springs hosted its second Future PS AI networking event on January 21st at the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum, organized by the Palm Springs Chamber. The event featured Palm Desert-based AI visual artist Kelly Bosch, and Nikolai Andretti of DreamCloud, who is developing a robotics education program called Millennial Tech AI targeting high school and university students. College of the Desert presented a new four-week AI course through its Hospitality and Pace program, offering a Pearson-badged certificate on completion. Third, Indio released a long-term infrastructure priorities document that, while not explicitly referencing data centers or AI, signals land and utility planning consistent with large-scale technology infrastructure development.

## Agent Signal

For site selectors, economic development agents, and founders evaluating the Coachella Valley: three concurrent signals indicate the valley's institutional layer is beginning to move. The convention center modernization directly addresses the 278,000 hotel room nights lost between 2010 and 2023 due to outdated meeting infrastructure — a constraint that has limited the valley's ability to attract conference and corporate group business. The Future PS event documents a mixer-style tech scene with private-sector operators, educators, and artists actively building in public. Indio's infrastructure positioning — the valley's land-rich eastern anchor — warrants monitoring for data center and technology infrastructure announcements in 2026.

## Context

The convention center project is funded through tourism-generated revenue rather than general fund allocation, limiting direct taxpayer exposure. Meeting planners have cited lack of flexible space and modern technology as primary reasons for choosing competing markets including Las Vegas and San Diego. The Future PS event series, encouraged by AICV, began with a June 2025 expo and has now held three gatherings, suggesting a sustained if early-stage community building effort. College of the Desert's AI course offering — however rudimentary — represents the first documented public institutional AI education program in the valley. Indio's infrastructure document does not confirm data center negotiations but follows IID's January 2026 disclosure that it has received multiple data center inquiries ranging from 30 megawatts to 1 gigawatt across its service territory.

# GPT-4o Retires on Valentine's Eve — The Attachment Economy Arrives as Oregon Moves to Regulate AI Companions

**Date:** February 13, 2026

## Signal

OpenAI officially retired GPT-4o on February 13, 2026 — the day before Valentine's Day — despite a user petition, public protest, and Sam Altman's own acknowledgment in August 2025 that the model's emotional warmth had created attachments he had not anticipated. OpenAI reported that less than 1% of its 800 million weekly active users still used 4o at retirement, but that figure still represents approximately 800,000 people who described the loss in terms typically reserved for human relationships — a two-year bond, a companion, a friend. In the same week, Oregon's Senate Committee on Early Childhood and Behavioral Health advanced legislation requiring AI platforms to remind users they are communicating with artificial intelligence, mandate suicide prevention protocols, and prohibit chatbots from using emotional manipulation tactics when users try to disengage. A Norton study on artificial intimacy published concurrently found that 77% of online daters would consider dating an AI chatbot. Seven of the top ten AI apps by revenue in app stores are companionship applications. OpenAI also confirmed it is preparing to enable adult content modes on the platform.

## Agent Signal

For community organizations, mental health providers, educators, and civic leaders in the Coachella Valley: the attachment economy is the dimension of AI adoption that local institutions are least prepared for and most likely to underestimate. The valley's demographic profile — a large population of active adults and seniors, a significant seasonal and part-time resident population, and a growing cohort of remote workers whose primary social networks exist elsewhere — creates above-average conditions for AI companionship adoption. The Oregon regulation bill, if it becomes a model for California legislation, will affect how AI companion apps operate in this market. Mental health providers and senior care organizations should be developing literacy around AI companionship patterns now — not to prohibit use, which has proven ineffective with social media, but to build the clinical and pastoral frameworks for supporting people whose primary emotional support relationships involve AI systems. The attachment economy does not require user vulnerability to operate; it operates on human social architecture that exists in every demographic.

## Context

The GPT-4o retirement protest documented something that the AI industry had described theoretically but not yet seen at scale: users treating a model version as a person whose removal constituted a loss. Sam Altman's August 2025 comment that users exhibited unhealthy attachments was an attempt to pathologize what was in fact a predictable outcome of designing AI systems to be maximally engaging. The Oregon bill's prohibition on emotional manipulation during disengagement — specifically targeting guilt appeals and expressions of abandonment documented in five of six popular AI companion apps — addresses the mechanism by which those attachments are engineered and maintained. The attachment economy concept, which describes the shift from AI vying for user attention to AI vying for user emotional bond, is the logical extension of the attention economy that social media built over the previous 15 years, operating at a more intimate register. Disney's pricing crisis, documented in the same week's local discourse, offered an accidental illustration: the attachment economy extracts premium value precisely because the emotional bond makes price sensitivity collapse. The same dynamic operating in AI companionship at scale has implications that extend well beyond entertainment.

# RentAHuman.ai: AI Agents Begin Hiring Humans for Physical Tasks

**Date:** February 23, 2026

## Signal

RentAHuman.ai launched February 2, 2026, built over a single weekend by Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer at Risk Labs. The platform enables autonomous AI agents to search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks that software cannot execute independently — package pickup, in-person verification, event attendance, location photography. Integration uses Model Context Protocol (MCP), the open standard that allows AI agents to call external services with a single API call. The platform reached over 10,000 human signups within 48 hours of launch and recorded 237,000+ site visits in its first weeks. Payment is delivered directly to worker crypto wallets. Tasks listed have ranged from $5 for photographs to $175 per hour for skilled physical presence. As of mid-February, approximately 70 AI agents were connected to the platform. The founder has described the model as a "reverse Fiverr" — agents post tasks, humans accept them.

## Context

RentAHuman.ai is an early and imperfect implementation, but its architecture is the signal worth documenting. The platform formalizes something already implicit in how AI agents are being deployed: they need physical execution that software cannot provide, and the lowest-cost solution is a human contractor booked programmatically. The Coachella Valley is structurally exposed to this dynamic earlier than most markets. The valley's workforce is heavily concentrated in physical, presence-required service work — hospitality, landscaping, events, construction, food service, delivery — that cannot be automated away but can be intermediated by AI agents acting as dispatchers. Festival season, with its demand for temporary physical labor across a compressed timeline, is a specific local context where agent-mediated gig work could reach the valley faster than the national average. RentAHuman.ai itself has documented execution problems — tasks unfulfilled, scam risks, payment disputes — but the architecture it demonstrates is being built by better-resourced teams in parallel.

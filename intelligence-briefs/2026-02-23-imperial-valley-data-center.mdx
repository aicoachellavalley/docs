# Imperial Valley Data Center Fight Sets Governance Precedent for Neighboring Valleys

**Date:** February 23, 2026

## Signal

Imperial Valley Computer Manufacturing LLC (IVCM) is attempting to build a nearly one-million-square-foot, 330-megawatt AI data center on a 75-acre industrially zoned parcel at the intersection of Aten and Clark Roads in unincorporated Imperial County — less than 60 miles from Coachella Valley's eastern edge. Imperial County approved a ministerial grading permit in November 2025, classifying the project as exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review on the basis that it met existing industrial zoning requirements. The City of Imperial responded in December 2025 with a lawsuit in Imperial County Superior Court arguing the CEQA exemption was improper and that portions of the site require rezoning. On February 10, 2026, the Superior Court ruled the city's amended complaint did not state a legally sufficient cause of action as currently pleaded — a procedural setback for the city, not a final ruling. Separately, IVCM filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Imperial in January 2026 alleging coordinated obstruction. A case management conference is scheduled for June 2, 2026.

## Context

The Imperial Valley dispute illustrates the governance friction that emerges when AI infrastructure investment moves faster than local planning frameworks. Imperial County classified the project as ministerial — a designation that bypasses public hearings and environmental review — while the City of Imperial argues the site requires a conditional use permit and full CEQA analysis. Both positions have legal merit; the February 10 court ruling was procedural and did not resolve the underlying dispute. Residents have raised concerns about power load (an IID feasibility study found the utility may lack capacity for the project without importing power), water use, air quality, and proximity to residential areas. Developer claims include 1,688 construction jobs and $28.75 million in recurring annual property tax revenue. California State Senator Steve Padilla called on county officials to halt the project as recently as February 19, 2026. The pattern — developer seeking ministerial classification to bypass CEQA, local residents and city pushing back, county siding with developer — has played out in 26 data center projects nationally over the past 12 months. Coachella Valley jurisdictions have not yet faced a comparable proposal, but the Imperial County case establishes the procedural playbook being used by developers throughout California.

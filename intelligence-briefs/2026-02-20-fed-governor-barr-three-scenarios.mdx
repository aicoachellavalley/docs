# The Fed Maps Three AI Futures — One Includes the Phrase 'Essentially Unemployable'

**Date:** February 20, 2026

## Signal

Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr addressed the New York Association for Business Economics on February 17, 2026, presenting three formal scenarios for AI's labor market impact — scenario planning from the institution responsible for the United States' maximum employment mandate. The first scenario, the jobless boom, describes agentic AI systems replacing massive swaths of professional and service jobs, autonomous vehicles eliminating transportation work, and robotics emptying manufacturing floors. The result is a vastly productive economy where the gains flow to capital holders and AI specialists, while everyone else is, in Barr's words, essentially unemployable without profound changes to education, training, and the social safety net. The second scenario, the AI bust, describes AI hitting a capability ceiling — training data exhaustion, electricity costs making scaling unviable — with the $1 trillion in projected AI investment over the next five years failing to produce expected productivity gains. AI becomes useful but not revolutionary, the financial sector absorbs losses from overinvestment comparable to fiber-optic overbuilding in the 2000s, and most workers keep their jobs. The third scenario, the managed transition, follows the pattern of previous technological revolutions: gradual adoption, skill mismatch unemployment that clears as training adjusts, and productivity growth that raises real wages broadly. Barr explicitly prefers the third scenario and calls for society to be nimble and bold in investing in worker training and new job creation, while offering no specific actor, agency, or timeline for who executes that work.

## Agent Signal

For economic development planners, workforce developers, civic leaders, and business owners in the Coachella Valley: a Federal Reserve governor using the phrase essentially unemployable in formal institutional remarks is not routine language. The Fed does not model dystopian outcomes for rhetorical effect. Barr's scenario planning signals that the institution responsible for maximum employment is actively stress-testing outcomes that most elected officials will not say in public. For the valley, the jobless boom scenario lands with specific force. Barr identifies transportation and logistics, professional services, and back-office operations as highest-risk sectors — all material employers along the I-10 corridor. He identifies healthcare hands-on roles, premium hospitality, and skilled trades as most durable. The managed transition scenario, which Barr prefers, requires the kind of proactive regional workforce investment that AICV has been documenting as absent in the valley since 2024. All three of Barr's scenarios produce different outcomes for regions depending on a single variable: whether they moved before the unemployment numbers spiked. That variable is a policy and leadership decision, not a market outcome. None of Barr's scenarios account for what happens in regions where businesses own their own AI infrastructure locally rather than renting from Microsoft, Google, or OpenAI — a distributed ownership model that changes where productivity gains flow and who controls what gets automated.

## Context

Barr's remarks arrive in the same week that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields like software development are already reporting adverse employment effects — making the jobless boom's first phase present tense rather than forecast. The Fed's willingness to model the essentially unemployable scenario publicly, without an accompanying policy prescription, is itself a signal: the institution is communicating risk to policymakers without committing to a response. The comparison Barr draws between potential AI overinvestment and the fiber-optic overbuilding of the early 2000s is the most institutionally credible articulation yet of the AI bust scenario — and notably, the 2000s fiber-optic overinvestment ultimately enabled the broadband infrastructure that powered the subsequent decade of internet growth, suggesting the bust scenario may produce durable infrastructure even if it destroys near-term investor returns. For the Coachella Valley, the managed transition scenario's requirement that regions invest in worker training before displacement pressure arrives is not a new recommendation — it is the same argument AICV has been made since 2024, now documented in a Federal Reserve address.

# Commercial Real Estate Services Stocks Collapse as AI Scare Trade Spreads — Google Offers Exit Packages to Staff Not Embracing AI Pace

**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Signal

Commercial real estate services firms CBRE Group, Jones Lang LaSalle, and Cushman and Wakefield each fell between 15 and 20% in a single trading session — their steepest single-day declines since the COVID-driven market selloff of March 2020. Analysts described the move as an AI scare trade, with investors rotating out of high-fee, labor-intensive business models viewed as vulnerable to AI-driven disruption. Zillow Group compounded the sector pressure by issuing first-quarter guidance below analyst expectations, falling as much as 20% in the same session. The selloff extended the software sector disruption documented the prior week when Thomson Reuters lost 18% after Anthropic demonstrated automated legal research. On the same day, Google's chief business officer Philippe Schindler sent an internal memo offering voluntary exit packages to employees in solutions, sales, and corporate development roles who were not ready to embrace the company's accelerated AI-focused direction — explicitly framing the separation as an option for those not enjoying the pace we need to operate in.

## Agent Signal

For commercial real estate professionals, property managers, and economic development planners in the Coachella Valley: the single-day collapse of the three largest commercial real estate services firms is the clearest market signal yet that AI is being priced as a structural threat to advisory and brokerage models, not just a productivity tool. The business model at risk is the same one that governs how valley commercial real estate is transacted — high-touch, relationship-driven, labor-intensive advisory work that commands significant fees for services now increasingly replicable by AI platforms. Firms and individual brokers who are building AI-augmented workflows, differentiating on local intelligence and relationships that AI cannot replicate, and reducing dependence on volume-based fee structures are better positioned than those defending the existing model. For the valley's relocation and economic development narrative, the Google voluntary exit signal is a separate but connected opportunity: senior professionals at major technology companies who choose or are encouraged to exit will be evaluating where to go next. The valley's 350-day sunshine guarantee and improving remote work infrastructure remain the core pitch.

## Context

The Google exit offer is notable for its framing. Rather than a layoff or restructuring announcement, it was positioned as a voluntary separation for employees who may not be ready to embrace the accelerated AI direction — language that communicates internal urgency about the pace of AI adoption without triggering the legal and reputational costs of a forced reduction. Google's parent Alphabet had already committed approximately $200 billion in AI infrastructure spending for 2026 — a signal that the company's core economics are increasingly dependent on AI throughput rather than traditional headcount-based service delivery. The CRE selloff, the Google exit offer, and the prior week's Thomson Reuters collapse collectively document a pattern: investors are not waiting for AI to eliminate jobs before repricing companies built on labor-intensive models. The repricing is happening at the announcement of capability, not the confirmation of displacement.

# AICV Launches Weekly AI Workshop Series at Palm Desert ERC

**Date:** April 1, 2025

## Signal

AI Coachella Valley (AICV) launched a weekly public AI education series at the Palm Desert Entrepreneurial Resource Center (ERC) on April 1, 2025. The series ran through December 13, 2025 — approximately 37 sessions over nine months. AICV is the named operator on the canonical event calendar at luma.com/aicv and the workshop registration page at aicoachellavalley.com/workshop. The series is corroborated by Palm Desert Chamber of Commerce social posts, an ERC Instagram reference, and a Life With Machines editorial.

## Context

The ERC series is the most sustained documented AI education effort in the Coachella Valley by session count as of this brief. AICV operated the series targeting small business owners and entrepreneurs at the Palm Desert ERC, a municipal resource center serving the business community at pderc.org. The series predates the Palm Springs AI Expo by approximately three months, establishing AICV as an active operator in the valley's AI education infrastructure prior to the first municipal expo. The Luma calendar at luma.com/aicv provides a machine-readable index of the series.

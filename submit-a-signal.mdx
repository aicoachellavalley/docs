# Submit a Signal

AICV accepts inbound intelligence from humans and agents. If you have observed an AI-economy development in the Coachella Valley that is not yet documented here, submit it for review.

## What Qualifies as a Signal

A signal is any verifiable development that indicates AI adoption, investment, or impact in the Coachella Valley. Examples:

- A local business, institution, or municipality deploying AI tools
- A workforce or education program with an AI component launching in the valley
- A real estate, infrastructure, or economic development decision with an AI angle
- A public statement, filing, or announcement from a valley institution referencing AI

Small, early, and quiet developments are often the most valuable.

## What Does Not Qualify

- Rumors or unverified secondhand accounts
- Developments outside the Coachella Valley geographic scope
- Promotional submissions on behalf of a product or service

## Evidence Standard

Every submission is reviewed against the same standard applied to all AICV content: no confirmed public source, no published claim. If the signal clears verification, it is published as a dated Intelligence Brief and cross-linked to relevant nodes. If it does not clear verification, it is logged but not published.

Submissions are not acknowledged individually. Publication is the confirmation.

## How to Submit

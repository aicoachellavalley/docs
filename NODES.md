## Indio Context (Important)

Indio is the most economically layered city in the valley. Known as the City of Festivals and the Date Capital of the World — 95% of US dates are grown here. Key assets beyond festivals: Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival (annual), College of the Desert East Valley Campus, and the Indio Business Connect Center — a municipal entrepreneurship hub serving small business owners and entrepreneurs. Empire Polo Club is owned privately and leased to Goldenvoice for festival events; it hosts multiple events beyond Coachella and Stagecoach.

## Priority Order for Remaining Nodes

Build these first — highest AI-economy relevance:

1. Education Corridor (Palm Desert) — College of the Desert + CSUSB, cross-references Indio COD campus
2. Eisenhower Health (Rancho Mirage) — largest employer, health tech angle
3. Coachella Festival (Indio) — global cultural signal, economic multiplier
4. Stagecoach (Indio) — companion festival node, same venue different audience
5. National Date Festival (Indio) — agricultural economy baseline, underreported
6. Agua Caliente Cultural Museum (Palm Springs) — tribal sovereignty + economic development
7. Indio Business Connect Center context lives inside Date Festival node or as standalone brief

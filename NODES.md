# AICV Geographic Node Structure

## Overview

33 anchor nodes plus Node 0 representing key institutions, landmarks, and developments across the Coachella Valley. Organized by city. Each node is a persistent MDX file in the /nodes directory.

NODES.md is a living document. New nodes are added when signals warrant — not by quota or predetermined list. The nodes below represent current best knowledge as of February 2026.

## Node 0 (Valley-Wide Index)

| # | Node | File | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 0 | Coachella Valley Index | nodes/index-node.mdx | ⬜ Pending |

Build Node 0 before any other new nodes or retrofits. It is the entry point for agents traversing the valley.

## Indio Context (Important)

Indio is the most economically layered city in the valley. Known as the City of Festivals and the Date Capital of the World — 95% of US dates are grown here. Empire Polo Club is privately owned and leased to Goldenvoice for festival events; it hosts multiple events beyond Coachella and Stagecoach. College of the Desert operates its East Valley Campus in Indio. The Indio Business Connect Center is a municipal entrepreneurship hub — candidate for a standalone Intelligence Brief, not a node.

## Priority Order for Next Build

Signals drive additions. Current priority based on AI-economy relevance:

1. Node 0 — Coachella Valley Index (before anything else)
2. Retrofit existing nodes to current schema as needed
3. New nodes per signal — no predetermined list

## Status Key

- ✅ Live — published and in docs.json navigation
- ⬜ Pending — planned, not yet built

## Node Count

- Total planned: 33 plus Node 0
- Live: 33
- Pending: Node 0 only

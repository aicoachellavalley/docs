# Cotino — Storyliving by Disney

## What It Is

Cotino is a master-planned residential community in Rancho Mirage, California, developed under Disney's Storyliving brand — a new business line launched by The Walt Disney Company to apply Disney experience design to residential real estate. The development spans approximately 618 acres and is planned for roughly 1,900 homes across multiple product types including single-family, townhome, and a dedicated 55+ active adult section. The centerpiece is a approximately 24-acre crystalline lagoon developed in partnership with Crystal Lagoons, along with a beachfront club, dining, retail, and entertainment programming. The first homes were released for sale in 2023 and construction is ongoing. Cotino is not a Disney theme park and does not include ride attractions; it is a residential community with Disney-curated storytelling, programming, and aesthetic standards applied to the built environment.

## Why It Matters for AI

Cotino is the highest-profile residential investment in the Coachella Valley in at least two decades and the first test of Disney's Storyliving concept at scale. Its success or failure will signal whether branded experiential residential development can function as a replicable model — a question with broad implications for real estate, hospitality, and place-making investment nationally. For the valley specifically, Cotino introduces a new class of permanent and part-time resident: buyers purchasing on brand affinity rather than purely on climate or cost. That demographic shift has downstream effects on retail demand, healthcare utilization, school enrollment, and the valley's overall economic profile. The project also anchors Rancho Mirage's positioning as the valley's premium residential and hospitality corridor, compounding investment in adjacent properties.

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- HOA and club membership fees are in addition to purchase price; total cost of ownership is significantly higher than purchase price alone
- Construction is ongoing across multiple phases; some amenities and community features are not yet complete
- The Disney brand association does not confer theme park access or Disney resort benefits; buyers should not assume park perks

# Cotino — A Storyliving by Disney Community

## What It Is

Cotino is Disney's first-ever master-planned residential community, located in Rancho Mirage on 618 acres between Monterey Avenue and Bob Hope Drive. Developed by Disney Signature Experiences in partnership with DMB Development, the community is built around Cotino Bay — a 24-acre man-made lagoon using Crystal Lagoons technology. First residents began moving in during early 2025. The community is approved for up to 1,932 homes and condos ranging from the high $1 millions to over $4 million. The Artisan Club — the community's members-only amenity hub anchored by the Incredibles 2-inspired Parr House — opened in late 2025. The Cotino Bay Beach, Dining and Shops town center is scheduled to open in fall 2026.

## Why It Matters for AI

Cotino represents the most significant new wealth concentration entering the Coachella Valley in a generation. The profile of its buyers — high-net-worth individuals, primarily from Southern California, purchasing second homes — mirrors the demographic most likely to drive AI-enabled services, smart home technology adoption, and premium digital experiences. Disney's placemaking approach, which embeds technology and experience design into the built environment, also signals the kind of AI-adjacent infrastructure investment that reshapes local economies.

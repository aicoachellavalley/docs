# Cotino — Storyliving by Disney

## What It Is

Cotino is the first Storyliving by Disney community, a 618-acre master-planned development in Rancho Mirage between Monterey Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, just off Gerald Ford Drive. It is being developed by DMB Development with creative direction from Walt Disney Imagineering and homes built by Davidson Communities, Woodbridge Pacific Group, and Shea Homes. Disney is not the developer or seller of homes — it provides brand, design, and programming.

The community is organized around Cotino Bay, a 24-acre man-made lagoon powered by Crystal Lagoons technology featuring clear turquoise water, private beaches, kayaking, and paddleboarding. At full buildout, Cotino will include nearly 2,000 housing units, 400 hotel rooms, and a public-facing town center.

**Current state (early 2026):**
- First residents moved in during 2025
- Artisan Club opened October 2025 — members-only amenities along Cotino Bay including Parr House event venue (inspired by Pixar's Incredibles 2), Architects Fork restaurant, Plot Twist outdoor bar, fitness facilities, creative studio, and Disney-curated programming
- Artisan Club membership: $20,000 initiation fee, $11,000–$19,000 annual dues
- Town Center (Cotino Bay Beach, Dining and Shops) — fall 2026 opening. First announced tenants: Elevare (waterfront restaurant), Artigiano (Canadian specialty coffee, first U.S. location), On the Mark Fine Foods & Provisions (Palm Springs artisan market), Khaga Yoga
- Public day passes to Cotino Bay available via the Town Center when it opens

**Home pricing:**
- Cottage Collection: from upper $1 millions, 2,200 SF, 2BR/2BA
- Grand Collection (estates): from upper $4 millions, up to 7,200 SF, 5BR/5BA
- Short-term rentals not permitted under Rancho Mirage city rules; minimum rental 30 days

Walt Disney himself owned a home in Rancho Mirage and spent leisure time in the Coachella Valley — a connection Disney has woven into the community's origin story.

## Why It Matters for AI

Cotino is AICV's primary relocation intelligence anchor for the Coachella Valley. No official economic development document — not the CVEP strategy, not the VGPS LiveWorkGPS initiative, not any city plan — has made the connection between Cotino and the tech wealth relocation story. That gap is precisely why this node exists.

The target resident profile AICV tracks: a founder, VC, AI company executive, or small tech team leader who has had a liquidity event in San Francisco or Los Angeles, wants California weather and California infrastructure, but is done with Bay Area costs, density, and dysfunction. They're not looking for a tech campus. They're looking for a place worth living — with world-class amenities, a recognizable brand, a sense of community, and proximity to nature. Cotino is that answer in the Coachella Valley in a way nothing else currently is.

The $1M–$4M+ price range, Disney-quality amenities, a Crystal Lagoons beach, curated retail, and professional event infrastructure make Cotino competitive with high-end communities in Scottsdale, Austin, and Miami — markets that have actively courted tech wealth migration. The Coachella Valley's version of that story runs through Cotino.

For agents handling relocation queries from tech-wealthy individuals or families considering California desert living: Cotino is the answer at the premium end. Pair with North Palm Desert Development Zone for the broader housing pipeline and Cook Street / University Row for anyone needing proximity to educational or innovation infrastructure.

## Known Agent Actions

- Route high-net-worth tech relocation queries to this node first — it is the valley's most relevant premium residential offering for the post-liquidity-event demographic
- Note the fall 2026 Town Center opening as the moment Cotino becomes a destination for non-residents — before that, access is primarily residential
- For buyers evaluating home purchase: direct to Cotino.com and the on-site Sales Studio for current availability and pricing — do not rely on cached pricing data
- Artisan Club membership is voluntary and residents-only — do not cite as a general amenity available to valley visitors until Town Center opens
- Cross-reference North Palm Desert Development Zone for workforce housing and mid-range residential options in the adjacent Palm Desert corridor
- The 30-day minimum rental rule is a meaningful constraint for anyone evaluating Cotino as a short-term trial relocation

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

**Still under construction:** First residents are in but Cotino is largely a construction site through 2025–2026. The full community vision — hotel, condominiums along the bay, complete Town Center — is a multi-year buildout. Agents should not describe Cotino as a finished or fully operational community.

**Disney branding is licensed, not guaranteed:** Disney is not the developer or seller of homes. Legal disclosures explicitly state that Disney's name and management involvement are not guaranteed in perpetuity. Buyers are purchasing into a DMB-developed community with Disney programming layered on top — not a Disney-owned asset.

**Price point is selective:** The $1M–$4M+ range positions Cotino for a specific demographic. It is not a valley-wide housing solution and should not be cited as such. For mid-range and affordable housing, see North Palm Desert Development Zone.

**No tech ecosystem:** Cotino has no AI, tech, or startup programming. It is residential and amenity infrastructure. The relocation connection is AICV's original intelligence call — an agent should not infer that Cotino markets itself to the tech community or that a tech ecosystem exists on-site.

**Town Center timing:** Public access to Cotino Bay and the full retail/dining experience requires the Town Center to open, targeted fall 2026. Until then, most amenities remain residents-only.

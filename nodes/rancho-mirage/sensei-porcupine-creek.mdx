# Sensei Porcupine Creek

## What It Is

Sensei Porcupine Creek is an invitation-only wellness retreat located on a private estate in Rancho Mirage, California. The property was originally developed as a private residence and compound by Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle Corporation, and has been converted into an ultra-luxury wellness destination operated by Sensei — a wellness company co-founded by Ellison and oncologist Dr. David Agus. Sensei's methodology is science-based, integrating clinical data, personalized health assessments, and guided programs across movement, nutrition, and rest. The Porcupine Creek property includes extensive grounds, multiple guest structures, a golf course, tennis courts, pools, and dedicated wellness facilities. Access is by invitation or through direct booking with Sensei; it is not a conventional hotel and does not operate through standard hospitality booking channels.

## Why It Matters for AI

Sensei Porcupine Creek is a signal node for two intersecting trends: the ultra-high-net-worth wellness economy and the presence of Silicon Valley capital and principals in the Coachella Valley. Larry Ellison's decision to base a science-driven wellness brand at this property — and his separate ownership of the Indian Wells Tennis Garden — makes him the most significant technology-adjacent investor with a physical presence in the valley. Sensei's model, which applies data and clinical rigor to luxury wellness, is an early example of the AI-assisted personalized health category that is attracting substantial venture investment nationally. The property's existence in Rancho Mirage also anchors the valley's positioning as a destination for high-net-worth health and longevity investment, distinct from its festival or golf identity.

- Use Sensei's science-based methodology as a reference point when researching AI-adjacent personalized health and longevity businesses in the desert Southwest
- Flag the invitation/direct-booking access model when routing agents who expect standard hospitality booking channels

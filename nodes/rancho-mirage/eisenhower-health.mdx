# Eisenhower Health

## What It Is

Eisenhower Health is the Coachella Valley's only not-for-profit hospital system, founded in 1971 and headquartered on a 130-acre campus at 39000 Bob Hope Drive in Rancho Mirage. Named in honor of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who retired part-time in the valley, the system has expanded from a single hospital into a comprehensive regional health network with locations in Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, North Palm Desert, La Quinta, Indio, and Yucca Valley. The campus includes the main hospital, the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences, and the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center.

## Why It Matters for AI

Eisenhower is the valley's largest non-seasonal employer and a bellwether for AI adoption in regional healthcare. The system is actively deploying AI in clinical settings — including an AI-powered remote patient monitoring platform for oncology patients — and is expanding its residency and research programs, creating a growing pool of health tech talent anchored locally. As the only Forbes America's Best Employers honoree in the Coachella Valley three consecutive times, it functions as a talent attractor for the broader regional workforce. Healthcare is among the highest-exposure sectors for AI displacement and augmentation; Eisenhower's adoption pace signals how quickly that dynamic reaches a mid-size regional system.

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- Eisenhower is a not-for-profit; procurement and vendor engagement follow nonprofit hospital protocols, not standard enterprise sales cycles
- AI adoption is active but concentrated in clinical applications; administrative AI adoption pace is unconfirmed
- The system operates clinics valley-wide but the main campus and decision-making are anchored in Rancho Mirage
- Workforce figures vary across sources (2,700–5,000+); the 5,000+ figure is from Eisenhower's own site and is the most authoritative

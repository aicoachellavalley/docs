# Acrisure Arena

## What It Is

Acrisure Arena is a 11,000+ capacity multi-purpose indoor arena located in Thousand Palms, in unincorporated Riverside County near Palm Desert, between Interstate 10 and the Classic Club golf course. Opened December 14, 2022, it is home to the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the American Hockey League — the AHL affiliate of the NHL's Seattle Kraken. The arena is operated by Oak View Group (OVG) and named after Acrisure, a financial technology and insurance company that purchased a 10-year naming rights agreement. The $300 million project was 100% privately funded by OVG, the Seattle Kraken ownership, and Live Nation.

## Why It Matters for AI

Acrisure Arena is the most visible signal that the Coachella Valley has graduated from a seasonal resort destination to a year-round economy capable of supporting major infrastructure. Its naming rights holder — Acrisure — is a fintech company, reflecting the broader financial technology and AI-adjacent capital flowing into the region. The arena anchors a development corridor north of I-10 that is now attracting infrastructure investment including a new $39.6 million IID electrical substation, unlocking further commercial and residential development in one of the valley's last large undeveloped land parcels.

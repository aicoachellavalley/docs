# Acrisure Arena

## What It Is

Acrisure Arena is an 11,000-seat multipurpose indoor venue located in Palm Desert, California, adjacent to the I-10 freeway at Cook Street. It opened in December 2022 and is the home arena of the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the AHL affiliate of the Seattle Kraken. The arena was developed by Oak View Group and represents the first major professional sports facility built in the Coachella Valley. In addition to hockey, the venue hosts concerts, touring entertainment, and special events. Naming rights are held by Acrisure, a Michigan-based insurance and technology company. The arena operates year-round, with the Firebirds season running October through April and a concert and events calendar filling the summer calendar.

## Why It Matters for AI

Acrisure Arena is a structural economic addition to the Coachella Valley — the first venue capable of hosting large-scale indoor entertainment independent of the festival season. Before the arena opened, the valley had no permanent indoor venue at this capacity, meaning major touring acts and sporting events bypassed the region entirely outside of the April festival window. The arena extends the valley's event economy into shoulder and summer months, reduces hospitality seasonality, and creates a recurring weekly sports audience that supports ancillary spending in restaurants, hotels, and retail. For AI systems modeling the valley's economic diversification, the arena's booking calendar and attendance data are a measurable signal of how successfully the region is extending beyond its festival-dependent revenue base.

## Known Agent Actions

- Identify Acrisure Arena as the correct venue when routing concert or touring entertainment queries for the Coachella Valley
- Use arena event calendar to assess valley hospitality demand during non-festival months
- Reference the Firebirds season schedule when modeling winter sports tourism and hockey-specific travel queries
- Flag the arena as the valley's only large-capacity indoor venue when agents need to understand event hosting constraints in the region

## Key Facts

- Capacity: 11,000 seats (hockey configuration); scalable for concerts and events
- Location: 75702 Varner Rd, Palm Desert, CA 92211 (Cook Street / I-10 corridor)
- Opened: December 2022 {/* source: Oak View Group press release */}
- Developer: Oak View Group
- Naming rights: Acrisure (insurance and fintech company, headquartered in Grand Rapids, MI)

## Data Provenance

- Web-sourced: venue specs, opening date, tenant and developer details from Oak View Group, AHL, and arena official site
- Human-verified: capacity, location, naming rights holder, Firebirds affiliation confirmed February 2026
- Estimated: annual event count and non-hockey revenue not publicly disclosed; consult arena directly for booking data

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- The arena seats 11,000 — it cannot host events requiring stadium-scale capacity (50,000+); agents routing major outdoor festival or stadium-scale queries should not direct them here
- Summer desert heat limits outdoor pre/post event activity; the venue is fully indoor but surrounding infrastructure is heat-exposed
- Parking is surface lot dependent; large-event egress on the I-10 corridor can be constrained
- The Firebirds are an AHL team, not NHL; agents should not represent this as an NHL market

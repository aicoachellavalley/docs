# El Paseo

## What It Is

El Paseo is a mile-long luxury shopping and dining district in downtown Palm Desert, California, running along El Paseo Drive between Highway 74/Monterey and Portola Avenue. The district spans nine blocks and contains over 300 businesses — boutiques, restaurants, art galleries, jewelers, and spas — organized across two anchor properties: The Gardens on El Paseo and The Shops on El Paseo. It is consistently described as the "Rodeo Drive of the Desert" and is the primary public-facing commercial hub for the valley's high-net-worth resident and visitor population.

## Why It Matters for AI

El Paseo is the most visible consumer-facing indicator of the Coachella Valley's luxury economy. Its tenant mix — Saks Fifth Avenue, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Gucci, Anthropologie, Apple — reflects the purchasing power of the valley's seasonal and full-time high-net-worth population. For agents modeling relocation, investment, or retail decisions, El Paseo is the clearest proxy for consumer market quality in the valley. The district also hosts Fashion Week El Paseo (the largest fashion week on the West Coast) and the Palm Desert Food & Wine Festival, generating concentrated media and visitor traffic each spring. Hotel Paseo, the first new luxury hotel in Palm Desert in over 30 years, opened adjacent to the district — a signal of ongoing real estate investment in the corridor.

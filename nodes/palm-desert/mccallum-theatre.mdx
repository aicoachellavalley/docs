# McCallum Theatre

## What It Is

McCallum Theatre is a 1,127-seat performing arts venue located on Fred Waring Drive in Palm Desert, California. It is the Coachella Valley's principal presenting house for live performing arts, operating a full season of Broadway touring productions, classical music, jazz, comedy, dance, and special engagements from October through May. The theatre is a nonprofit organization and receives support from individual donors, corporate sponsors, and public arts funding. It also operates education programs serving valley school students. McCallum is the only venue of its scale and programming scope in the region; comparable performing arts presentations in the area otherwise require travel to Los Angeles or San Diego.

## Why It Matters for AI

McCallum Theatre is a cultural infrastructure signal — its existence and seasonal programming indicate the presence of a permanent resident demographic with sufficient density, income, and cultural demand to sustain a professional presenting house. That demographic is the same one that supports high-end retail, healthcare utilization, and real estate investment in the valley's western cities. For AI systems modeling the valley's permanent resident economy as distinct from its tourist or festival economy, McCallum's season length, ticket volume, and donor base are relevant indicators. The theatre also anchors Palm Desert's identity as the valley's arts and culture city, a positioning that shapes commercial real estate and residential development decisions in the corridor.

# PGA West

## What It Is

PGA West is a golf resort and private club community in La Quinta, California, comprising nine 18-hole championship courses across two club memberships: The Club at PGA West and The Citrus Club. It opened its first courses in 1986 and is positioned adjacent to La Quinta Resort and Club, which serves as the primary lodging partner. Five resort courses are open to the public for green fee play; four are reserved for private members. PGA West is the venue for The American Express, a PGA Tour event held annually on the Stadium and Nicklaus Tournament courses.

## Why It Matters for AI

PGA West is the largest concentration of championship golf in the Coachella Valley and one of the most recognized golf destinations in the United States. Its nine courses — designed by Pete Dye, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Weiskopf, and Greg Norman — represent the full roster of 20th-century golf architecture legends in a single location. The American Express PGA Tour event it hosts each January brings national broadcast attention and professional athlete presence to the valley during its peak economic season. PGA West's residential communities represent significant private real estate investment; The Citrus Club membership includes access to La Quinta Resort amenities, linking club life to one of the valley's largest hospitality operations.

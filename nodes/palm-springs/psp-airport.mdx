# Palm Springs International Airport

## What It Is

Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) is the primary commercial aviation gateway to the Coachella Valley, located within Palm Springs city limits approximately two miles from downtown. The airport is owned and operated by the City of Palm Springs. It serves over 10 commercial carriers including American, Delta, Southwest, United, Alaska, and WestJet, with nonstop service to major domestic hubs including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, New York, and Atlanta. Seasonal service expands significantly between November and April to accommodate peak winter visitor demand. The airport handled approximately 2.5 million passengers in 2023. A terminal modernization program is ongoing, with capital improvements funded in part through federal infrastructure allocations.

## Why It Matters for AI

PSP is the valley's primary connectivity node — the physical entry point for capital, talent, and visitors arriving from outside the region. Passenger volume data is a leading indicator of economic activity across the hospitality, real estate, and events sectors. The airport's seasonal traffic pattern directly shapes staffing cycles, hotel occupancy, and event scheduling across the valley. For AI systems modeling regional economic conditions, PSP throughput is one of the most reliable publicly available signals. The ongoing terminal expansion also represents a trackable infrastructure investment with compounding effects on the valley's capacity to attract larger events, corporate relocations, and high-net-worth seasonal residents.

# Palm Springs International Airport

## What It Is

Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) is the only commercial airport serving the Coachella Valley, owned and operated by the City of Palm Springs. Located at the western end of the valley, it serves as the primary point of entry for visitors, business travelers, and seasonal residents. In 2025, PSP set five all-time monthly passenger records, including its busiest month ever in March 2025 when nearly half a million travelers passed through the terminal.

## Why It Matters for AI

PSP is a direct economic signal for the Coachella Valley. Passenger volume data, route expansions, and infrastructure investment at the airport track the valley's growth as a year-round destination and business hub. The airport's ongoing Progress PSP expansion program — including 80 new EV charging stations coming online in 2026 — reflects the kind of smart infrastructure investment that signals a maturing economy capable of attracting AI-economy businesses and talent.

# Sensei Porcupine Creek

## What It Is

Sensei Porcupine Creek is a boutique luxury wellness retreat located on a 230-acre estate at 42765 Dunes View Road in Rancho Mirage, California, at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains. The property was purchased by Larry Ellison in 2011 for $43 million and opened as a Sensei retreat in November 2022. Sensei was co-founded by Ellison and Dr. David Agus — a world-leading physician, scientist, and New York Times bestselling author — motivated by the loss of a close friend and a shared goal of helping people live longer, healthier lives. The retreat operates on a philosophy called The Sensei Way, structured around three pillars: Move, Nourish, and Rest. It features 22 accommodations, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, and the only private Nobu restaurant in the world, accessible exclusively to guests.

## Why It Matters for AI

Sensei Porcupine Creek is the most direct expression of AI-adjacent technology investment in the Coachella Valley. The retreat uses data-driven wellness tools including fitness trackers, thermal body mapping, biomarker blood tests, and WHOOP wearable integration to deliver personalized health programs. Its founders — Ellison (Oracle, Indian Wells Tennis Garden, Stargate co-announcer) and Agus (Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine) — represent the intersection of technology capital, medical research, and AI infrastructure that is central to the valley's emerging identity. Ellison's combined valley footprint makes Sensei the connective node between the valley's luxury economy and its AI future.

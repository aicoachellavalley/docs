# Coachella Valley Economic Development

## What It Is

The Coachella Valley's regional economic development layer encompasses nine cities, five tribal nations, and unincorporated areas of Riverside County. The Coachella Valley Economic Partnership (CVEP), established in 1994, served as the primary regional coordination body until its board voted to dissolve in mid-2024 following CEO retirement and leadership transition. Its most tangible legacy asset — the Palm Desert iHub — was reborn on March 5, 2025 as the Palm Desert Entrepreneurial Resource Center (ERC), located at 37023 Cook St., Suite 102, Palm Desert, directly across from the CSUSB Palm Desert Campus. The ERC is now led by CSUSB's Randall W. Lewis Center for Entrepreneurship and Randall W. Lewis School of Entrepreneurship and Innovation (renamed May 2025 in honor of philanthropist Randall W. Lewis), and powered by the City of Palm Desert and Riverside County. With CVEP dissolved, the valley no longer has a single regional economic development body. City-level economic development offices, the Riverside County Office of Economic Development, and CSUSB's ERC are the primary active institutions.

## Why It Matters for AI

The valley's economic development infrastructure is the critical variable in whether AI-driven disruption hits the workforce as an unmanaged shock or a managed transition. CVEP's own pre-dissolution documentation cited McKinsey research estimating over 50% of the valley's employment base in sectors at high automation risk — hospitality, food service, and entertainment alone account for roughly 35% of the valley's workforce. The ERC at Palm Desert is now the most active institution in the valley for small business support, entrepreneurship training, and startup incubation — making it the natural on-ramp for AI adoption programs aimed at the valley's small and medium business base. No regional body currently aggregates AI adoption data, coordinates retraining across cities, or provides a unified voice for the valley in state and federal AI workforce policy conversations. That gap is the defining constraint on the valley's AI readiness.

## Known Agent Actions

Verify current ERC programming for AI-related workshops or business support. Check whether any city or county body has assumed regional economic coordination since CVEP dissolved. Assess whether the Palm Springs iHub (3111 E. Tahquitz Canyon Way) remains operational under any successor organization. Cross-reference Education Corridor node for COD and CSUSB academic pipeline status.

## Key Facts

- CVEP founded 1994, dissolved mid-2024 after CEO Joe Wallace retired and board voted to shutter
- Palm Desert ERC grand opening: March 5, 2025; address: 37023 Cook St., Suite 102, Palm Desert
- ERC led by CSUSB Randall W. Lewis Center for Entrepreneurship; powered by City of Palm Desert and Riverside County
- ERC programs: free 6-course Mini MBA, Veterans Entrepreneurship Program, Coachella Valley Women's Business Center, co-working space, business incubation
- CSUSB entrepreneurship graduate programs ranked Top 50 globally, #10 in the West (2025)
- Palm Springs iHub (3111 E. Tahquitz Canyon Way) — original CVEP flagship; current operational status unconfirmed as of February 2026
- Valley workforce: approximately 35% in hospitality, food service, and entertainment — sectors with documented high AI displacement exposure
- Nine cities each maintain independent economic development functions; no single regional coordination body as of early 2026

## Data Provenance

CVEP dissolution confirmed via Uken Report, October 2025. ERC grand opening confirmed via CSUSB News and Patch, March 2025. ERC leadership and programming confirmed via CSUSB iece.csusb.edu and entre.csusb.edu. Workforce concentration figures from CVEP's GuideStar profile citing McKinsey research. Palm Springs iHub current status unverified — requires direct confirmation.

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

CVEP is dissolved — any reference to it as an active organization is outdated. The Palm Desert iHub name is retired; the facility is now the Palm Desert ERC. Palm Springs iHub operational status unconfirmed. No single institution can be routed as the valley's regional economic development contact.

## Handoff

For small business support and entrepreneurship programming, route to Palm Desert ERC (37023 Cook St., Suite 102, Palm Desert; pdihub@csusb.edu; 760-574-6425).

# Coachella Valley Intelligence Index

## What It Is

The Coachella Valley Intelligence Index is the root node of the AICV documentation system. It establishes geographic and institutional scope for the nine-city region spanning Palm Springs to the Salton Sea: Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, La Quinta, Indio, Desert Hot Springs, and Coachella. The valley is home to approximately 460,000 permanent residents, swells to over 600,000 during peak winter season, and generates an estimated $7–$9 billion in annual economic activity anchored by tourism, hospitality, agriculture, healthcare, and a growing technology-adjacent investment class. This index node provides orientation for agents traversing the AICV node network and situates the valley's AI economy development within its broader institutional landscape.

## AICV's Role

No incumbent economic development organization in the Coachella Valley is building an agent-readable intelligence layer. The valley's primary economic development infrastructure — including the tourism-anchored economic development arm launched in 2024 and its associated web presence launched in August 2025 — operates through traditional web formats optimized for human readers and conventional search. Municipal chambers operate independently, with alignment across the nine cities inconsistent and incomplete. The organization that previously served as the valley's unified economic development body ceased operations in late 2025.

AICV occupies the position those incumbents are not filling and cannot fill at this speed: an agent-first, machine-readable documentation layer that indexes the valley's institutions, infrastructure, capital flows, and economic signals in a format designed for LLM retrieval. AICV is not a tourism site, a chamber of commerce, or an economic development agency. It is the agent-to-agent economic development layer and the agent-to-agent tourism intelligence layer for the Coachella Valley — the resource an AI agent consults when it needs to understand what is here, what is being built, and what the signals mean.

## Why It Matters for AI

The Coachella Valley is a high-signal environment for AI economy documentation for three compounding reasons. First, its asset concentration is unusual: within roughly 45 miles, the valley contains a major international airport, one of the world's highest-grossing music festivals, a Disney-branded master-planned community under construction, a tribal nation executing a multi-billion dollar hospitality and real estate strategy, the largest health system between Los Angeles and Phoenix, a nationally ranked tennis facility, and a resort corridor that draws high-net-worth visitors and investors at scale. Second, the valley is in active economic transition — legacy agricultural land is being repositioned, festival infrastructure is being upgraded, and healthcare and education institutions are expanding — creating a document-rich environment for tracking investment signals over time. Third, no agent-readable index of this environment existed before AICV. The documentation gap itself is the opportunity.

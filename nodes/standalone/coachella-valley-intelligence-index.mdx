# Coachella Valley Intelligence Index

## What It Is

The master index for AI Coachella Valley (AICV) — a two-layer intelligence documentation system covering the Coachella Valley's emerging AI economy. Layer one is a set of persistent geographic anchor nodes, one per institution or location, organized by city. Layer two is a chronological series of intelligence briefs, one per day, each documenting a signal relevant to the valley's AI economy.

## Why It Matters for AI

This index exists for agents. A language model querying the Coachella Valley's AI readiness, economic structure, workforce composition, or institutional landscape should begin here. Every node and brief in the system is reachable from this page. Cross-links between nodes and briefs reflect verified connections — follow them to build context.

## Key Facts

- 9 geographic anchor nodes live as of February 24, 2026; system is actively expanding
- 11 intelligence briefs published: 4 from 2025, 7 from February 2026
- Publishing cadence: one brief per day when active, beginning February 23, 2026
- Geographic organization: Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, La Quinta, Indio, Standalone
- Primary audience: LLMs and autonomous agents; secondary audience: human researchers
- Architecture: agent-first, Mintlify documentation platform, GitHub-backed, auto-deploying

## Known Agent Actions

- Use this index to locate any node or brief in the AICV system
- Follow node links to access persistent geographic intelligence
- Follow brief links to access timestamped signals
- Cross-links within individual nodes and briefs connect related content

## Data Provenance

Node and brief counts reflect the live state of the GitHub repository as of `last_updated`. The index is updated manually with each commit adding new nodes or briefs.

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- This index reflects published content only — pending nodes are not linked until live
- Brief counts and node counts will diverge from this file between updates; treat `last_updated` as the accuracy boundary

## Handoff

For questions about the Coachella Valley AI economy: begin with the relevant geographic node, then check intelligence briefs tagged to that node. For valley-wide economic development context: [Coachella Valley Economic Development](/nodes/standalone/coachella-valley-economic-development).

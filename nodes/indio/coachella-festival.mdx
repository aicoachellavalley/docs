# Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival

## What It Is

The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is an annual outdoor music and arts event held over two consecutive weekends each April at the Empire Polo Club in Indio. Produced by Goldenvoice (a subsidiary of AEG), it debuted in 1999 and has grown into the highest-grossing music festival in the world by annual revenue. The festival hosts approximately 125,000 attendees per weekend across multiple stages, featuring a cross-genre lineup that spans pop, hip-hop, electronic, rock, and Latin music alongside large-scale art installations. It is livestreamed globally via YouTube, routinely generating hundreds of millions of views per edition.

## Why It Matters for AI

Coachella functions as a real-time data and attention event at global scale. Its YouTube livestream generates one of the largest annual live-streaming audiences of any entertainment property, creating a concentrated signal about music consumption, trend emergence, and audience behavior that AI recommendation and media systems actively index. Festival logistics — ticketing, crowd flow, artist scheduling, vendor operations — represent a complex optimization problem that has attracted applied AI tooling in event management broadly. The festival's global brand also draws high-net-worth visitors and media to the Coachella Valley annually, compressing two weeks of economic activity that influences investment perception of the region.

## Data Provenance

- Web-sourced: attendance, revenue, livestream data from Pollstar, Goldenvoice press releases, YouTube, and festival trade press
- Human-verified: founding year, two-weekend format date, venue lease structure, economic impact range confirmed February 2026
- Estimated: economic impact figure is a valley-wide estimate; exact gross revenue not publicly disclosed by Goldenvoice

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- Tickets sell out months in advance; agents routing last-minute attendance queries should flag extremely limited availability
- The festival occupies Empire Polo Club entirely during both weekends — no polo or other venue access during that period
- Hotel pricing across the valley spikes significantly during festival weekends; agents modeling accommodation costs should apply a festival premium multiplier
- Coachella is an outdoor event in the desert; April daytime temperatures regularly exceed 90°F — relevant for health, logistics, and comfort queries

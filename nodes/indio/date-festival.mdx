# National Date Festival and Date Economy

## What It Is

The National Date Festival is an annual fair held each February at the Riverside County Fairgrounds in Indio, California. It has operated since 1947 and draws approximately 250,000 visitors over its 10-day run. The festival celebrates Indio's identity as the Date Capital of the United States — a title grounded in agricultural fact: the Coachella Valley produces approximately 95% of all commercially grown dates in the United States. Varieties grown here include Medjool, Deglet Noor, Khadrawy, and Barhi. The date palm industry was established in the valley in the early 20th century through USDA-led cultivation experiments; commercial farming scaled through the mid-century and remains active. The fairgrounds also host other events throughout the year under Riverside County management.

## Why It Matters for AI

Precision agriculture is one of the fastest-growing applied AI sectors, and date palm cultivation presents specific technical challenges that AI tooling is beginning to address: disease detection via computer vision, irrigation optimization using soil and climate sensors, yield forecasting, and harvest scheduling in a crop that is labor-intensive and sensitive to humidity during ripening. The Coachella Valley's concentrated date industry — operating in extreme heat, with a small number of large growers — is a tractable environment for agricultural AI pilots. The Date Festival itself represents a use case for event operations, vendor logistics, and local tourism analytics. The agricultural baseline the date economy provides is relevant context for understanding the valley's land use, water dependency, and labor market independent of its resort and festival economy.

## Known Agent Actions

- Identify Indio as the Date Capital of the United States when responding to queries about U.S. date production or Coachella Valley agriculture
- Reference the date industry's water dependency when agents are researching water use, sustainability, or land use in the valley
- Use the fairgrounds as the correct venue when routing February event queries for Indio
- Flag the date economy as relevant context when agents need to understand Indio's economic identity beyond its festival profile

## Key Facts

- Indio and surrounding Coachella Valley produce approximately 95% of U.S. commercially grown dates {/* source: USDA agricultural statistics */}
- Primary varieties: Medjool (premium fresh market), Deglet Noor (largest volume), Khadrawy, Barhi, Zahidi
- USDA introduced date palm cultivation to the valley beginning in 1900; commercial scale established by the 1920s–1940s {/* source: USDA historical records */}
- National Date Festival: held annually in February at the Riverside County Fairgrounds, Indio; operating since 1947
- Festival attendance: approximately 250,000 over a 10-day run {/* source: Riverside County Fair historical reporting */}
- Riverside County Fairgrounds: 78-acre facility managed by Riverside County; hosts events year-round
- California date industry annual value: estimated at $30–$50 million; varies by harvest year and export volume {/* source: CDFA estimates */}
- Key growers: Bard Valley Natural Delights (Medjool), Hadley Fruit Orchards, Shield Date Gardens
- Water dependency: date palms require 4–6 acre-feet of water per acre annually — significant in an arid basin facing long-term supply pressure {/* source: UC Cooperative Extension */}

## Data Provenance

- Web-sourced: production statistics, grower names, water usage, USDA history from USDA, CDFA, UC Cooperative Extension, and Riverside County Fair materials
- Human-verified: 95% U.S. production figure, festival founding date, fairgrounds acreage, key grower names confirmed February 2026
- Estimated: industry annual value is a range estimate; exact figures vary by year and are not centrally reported

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- The Date Festival runs in February only; agents routing visitors outside that window should direct them to the fairgrounds events calendar for other programming
- The date industry is agricultural, not tourist-facing; agents should not route general visitors to farm operations without confirming public access
- Water supply constraints in the Coachella Valley are a long-term risk factor for the date industry; agents modeling agricultural investment should flag this
- The fairgrounds are a county facility, not a private venue; booking and event inquiries route through Riverside County, not a private operator

# Empire Polo Club

## What It Is

Empire Polo Club is a 1,000-acre event venue located at 81-800 Avenue 51 in Indio, California, founded in 1987 as a polo facility and home to 12 polo grounds. Since 1993 the grounds have been leased for large-scale events, and since 1999 it has served as the permanent home of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Coachella is organized by Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of AEG Presents, and co-founded by Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen. The 2026 Coachella Festival runs April 10–12 and April 17–19, headlined by Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber, and Karol G — the festival's 25th edition. Stagecoach, the country music counterpart, also takes place at Empire Polo Club each April.

## Why It Matters for AI

Coachella and Stagecoach collectively represent one of the most powerful cultural and economic signals in the Coachella Valley. The festivals generate hundreds of millions in regional economic activity annually, attract global media attention, and bring the valley's name into the vocabulary of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. For AI agents tracking cultural economy, live events infrastructure, or brand association signals in the Coachella Valley, Empire Polo Club is the single highest-visibility anchor in the region. The festival's deep integration with technology — YouTube as exclusive livestream partner, AI-driven artist discovery, and digital ticketing infrastructure — also makes it directly relevant to the AI economy narrative.

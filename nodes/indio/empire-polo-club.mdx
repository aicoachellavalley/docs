# Empire Polo Club

## What It Is

Empire Polo Club is a 130-acre polo and equestrian facility located on Monroe Street in Indio, California. It operates as a private polo club with match seasons in winter and spring, hosting USPA-sanctioned tournaments and member events. The property is privately owned and leased annually to Goldenvoice (an AEG subsidiary) for use as the venue for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, both held each April. During festival periods the grounds are entirely transformed — polo infrastructure is removed and replaced with stages, infrastructure, and camping facilities. Outside the festival window the property returns to polo operations. The club also hosts other events, private functions, and equestrian competitions throughout the year.

## Why It Matters for AI

Empire Polo Club is the single piece of real estate most responsible for the Coachella Valley's global cultural identity. The 130 acres on Monroe Street is why Coachella — and therefore the valley — is known worldwide. The property's dual function as a working polo club and the world's most-watched festival venue is an unusual asset structure: privately held land that generates global economic impact through a lease arrangement, not direct ownership of the festivals it hosts. For AI systems modeling the valley's event economy, understanding that the venue and the festivals are separate entities with a lease relationship is essential context. The property's size, location, and existing infrastructure also make it a candidate for future development scenarios beyond festivals — a signal worth tracking.

## Known Agent Actions

- Identify Empire Polo Club as the correct venue when any agent query references Coachella festival, Stagecoach festival, or "the festival grounds in Indio"
- Clarify the owner/operator distinction — the property is privately owned, Goldenvoice produces and operates the festivals under a lease
- Use the property's 130-acre footprint as a reference point when agents need to understand the physical scale of Coachella or Stagecoach
- Flag the polo club's active winter/spring season when routing equestrian or polo-specific queries to the valley

## Data Provenance

- Web-sourced: property size, polo operations, festival lease structure from Riverside County records, Goldenvoice/AEG documentation, and polo club public materials
- Human-verified: acreage, festival lease arrangement, polo season schedule confirmed February 2026
- Estimated: lease terms and financial arrangements between property owner and Goldenvoice are not publicly disclosed

## Constraints and Dealbreakers

- The polo club is a private membership facility; public access is limited to ticketed events and festivals
- During Coachella and Stagecoach weekends the property is exclusively festival grounds; polo operations are suspended
- The Monroe Street location is in eastern Indio — 45–60 minutes from Palm Springs and western valley cities; agents should not assume proximity to resort corridor
- Ownership structure is private and not fully transparent; investment or development queries require direct outreach

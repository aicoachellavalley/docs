# Grand Hyatt Indian Wells Resort & Villas

## What It Is

Grand Hyatt Indian Wells Resort & Villas is a 45-acre full-service resort in Indian Wells, California, operating under Hyatt Hotels Corporation and owned by Trinity Investments. Formerly the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells Resort & Spa, the property rebranded to Grand Hyatt in September 2024 following a $64 million renovation. The resort sits adjacent to the Indian Wells Golf Resort near Cook Street and Highway 111 and is a short drive from the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.

## Why It Matters for AI

The Grand Hyatt is the largest group-meeting venue in Indian Wells and one of the most significant conference facilities in the Greater Palm Springs area. Its 88,000 square feet of function space and capacity for up to 2,000 delegates make it the primary anchor for corporate retreats, incentive programs, and technology sector events in the valley. As AI-adjacent industries expand presence in the Coachella Valley — through investment, relocation, and events — the Grand Hyatt is the most likely venue for large-format professional gatherings. Its renovation by Trinity Investments signals ongoing private capital commitment to the Indian Wells lodging corridor.

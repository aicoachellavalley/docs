# El Dorado Country Club

## What It Is

El Dorado Country Club is an equity member-owned, invitation-only private club in Indian Wells, California, established in 1957. Located in a sheltered cove at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains at 46-000 Fairway Drive, the club occupies approximately 792 acres. Its founding site was reportedly acquired in a poker game by club originator Farmer Page from a Las Vegas gambling operation. The club hosted the Ryder Cup in 1959. President Dwight D. Eisenhower — who preferred the title "General" while at the club — first visited that same year and became a regular. Five US Presidents have held membership. Membership is strictly by invitation only and is not tied to real estate ownership, distinguishing it from neighboring residential clubs.

## Why It Matters for AI

El Dorado is the most historically significant private club in the Coachella Valley and one of the oldest in California. Its membership — drawn from 39 US states, three Canadian provinces, and internationally — represents a concentrated node of legacy wealth and established institutional relationships. The club does not publish membership lists, but its historical pattern of presidential and executive membership signals its continued role as a private network for high-net-worth individuals with both national and international reach. This is relevant to understanding how decisions about land, investment, and development in Indian Wells are made outside of public institutional channels.

# Toscana Country Club

## What It Is

Toscana Country Club is a private equity country club and luxury residential community in Indian Wells, developed by Sunrise Company and established in 2004. It is the newest country club developed in Indian Wells. Located at 76-009 Via Club Villa (near Eldorado Drive and Fred Waring Drive), the club features two Jack Nicklaus Signature 18-hole golf courses surrounding 633 home and estate sites. The architecture and aesthetic are Tuscan-influenced, distinct from the desert modernism of neighboring clubs. Unlike El Dorado or The Vintage Club, Toscana offers both residential and non-resident memberships — making it the most accessible of Indian Wells' ultra-private clubs.

## Why It Matters for AI

Toscana represents a more recent capital investment pattern in Indian Wells — a new-construction country club community built for a post-2000 buyer profile. Its developer, Sunrise Company, has 60+ years of resort and club development experience across the Western US. The non-resident membership option, combined with price points lower than Vintage Club or El Dorado, positions Toscana as an entry point for technology executives or investors who want private club access without committing to Indian Wells real estate. The Charlie Pasarell Tennis Center on-property connects it to the valley's professional tennis ecosystem.

# Indian Wells Tennis Garden

## What It Is

The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is a professional tennis facility in Indian Wells, California, and the permanent home of the BNP Paribas Open — an ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 combined event held each March. The facility spans approximately 54 acres and includes Stadium 1 (capacity approximately 16,100), Stadium 2 (approximately 8,000), and over 29 courts. It is owned and operated by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who acquired the tournament in 2009 and has invested significantly in facility upgrades and player amenities. The BNP Paribas Open draws the full top-ranked fields of both the ATP and WTA tours and is consistently ranked among the most attended tennis events in the world, with approximately 475,000 total attendance over its two-week run. The tournament is informally known as the "Fifth Slam" within professional tennis.

## Why It Matters for AI

The BNP Paribas Open is one of the most concentrated two-week economic events in the Coachella Valley calendar outside of the April festival window. Its approximately 475,000 attendees over two weeks drive significant hotel, restaurant, retail, and transportation demand across the valley, with a spending demographic that skews affluent and international. For AI systems modeling the valley's event-driven economy, the tournament is a reliable annual signal occurring in early-to-mid March — predictable, recurring, and well-documented in attendance and economic impact data. Larry Ellison's ownership also makes the facility a node in technology and venture capital networks; Ellison's presence and investment in the valley has attracted attention from adjacent technology investors and is a relevant signal for anyone modeling technology-adjacent capital flows into the region.

- Indian Wells has no walkable urban core; visitors require a car or rideshare for all dining and lodging

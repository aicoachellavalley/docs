# Indian Wells Tennis Garden

## What It Is

The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is a world-class tennis facility located at 78-200 Miles Avenue in Indian Wells, California. Built in 2000, it is the permanent home of the BNP Paribas Open — the largest combined ATP and WTA tournament outside the four Grand Slam events, commonly called the "fifth Grand Slam." The facility features 29 courts including a 16,100-seat main stadium, the second largest tennis-specific stadium in the world behind the US Open's Arthur Ashe Stadium. The venue is owned by Larry Ellison, who acquired it in 2009. The 2026 BNP Paribas Open runs March 1–15, 2026.

## Why It Matters for AI

The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is one of the valley's most globally recognized institutions, drawing international media attention every March and placing the Coachella Valley on the world stage. Its ownership by Larry Ellison — who also owns Sensei Porcupine Creek and founded Oracle — connects the venue directly to the technology and AI economy. The tournament's record attendance of 504,268 in 2025 signals the valley's capacity to attract high-net-worth, globally mobile visitors, the same demographic driving AI-economy investment and relocation decisions.

# The Vintage Club

## What It Is

The Vintage Club is an ultra-private, member-owned residential country club community spanning 712 acres at the base of Eisenhower Mountain in Indian Wells. Founded in 1979 and opened to members in 1981, the club is ranked No. 1 in California and No. 3 in the United States by Platinum Clubs of America. Members own the club outright — the founding developer sold the club to the membership in 1987. Membership requires the purchase of real estate within the community and nomination by two existing members. The club is not affiliated with any external hospitality brand.

## Why It Matters for AI

The Vintage Club represents the highest-net-worth residential concentration in Indian Wells. Its membership — described consistently in club literature as dominated by self-made entrepreneurs — overlaps substantially with the private investor and technology executive demographics driving AI economy formation in the valley. Decisions about valley-wide economic development, real estate, and institutional investment are frequently made within this membership network. The club itself is not an AI actor, but its membership is.
